Blog application created using React-Router actions and loaders. Loaders and actions allow you to conditionally render components based on the route or state of the application. We can make fetch requests based on a current route, which also cleans up your component code by abstracting away complex logic related to data fetching and rendering. Loaders are for any kind of GET request, and Actions are for any other mutation request. Loaders can help optimize resource usage by ensuring that data is only fetched when necessary, based on the current route. This can prevent unnecessary API calls and reduce the load on the server, improving overall performance and scalability of the application.
